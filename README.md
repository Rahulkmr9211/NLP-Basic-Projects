To get started in NLP, this repository will help you with basic projects

# Project 1 - SMS Spam Classifier
Data Set : Imbalanced Text type
Steps Followed to clean dataset: Removing non text word, convering to lower case, tokenization, removing stop words, then stemming.

Using Bag of word techniques, taking maximum features = 2500( originally it was 6000+ but since maximum block only contains zero values, so I have taken randomnly lesser features with maximum frequency)

Model Selection: Naive Bais
Accuracy metrices: Confusion Text Data

This project is inspired by Krish Naik playlist on NLP.

# Project 2 - Stock Sentiment Analysis
This project based on movement of stock based on the news headlines. 
Its a binary classification problem, 
class 0: Stock price stayed same or decreased :: class 1: Stock price Increases

Here again bag of word technique has been used and the model selected is random forecast classifier.
Accuracy metrices: confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
