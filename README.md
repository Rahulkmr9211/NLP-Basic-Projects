# Project 1 - SMS Spam Classifier
Data Set : Imbalanced Text type
Steps Followed to clean dataset: Removing non text word, convering to lower case, tokenization, removing stop words, then stemming.

Using Bag of word techniques, taking maximum features = 2500( originally it was 6000+ but since maximum block only contains zero values, so I have taken randomnly lesser features with maximum frequency)

Model Selection: Naive Bais
Accuracy metrices: Confusion Text Data

This project is inspired by Krish Naik playlist on NLP.
